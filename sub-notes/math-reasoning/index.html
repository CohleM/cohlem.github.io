  "articleBody": "behaviors:\nError recognition and Correction Knowledge Tom plays 6 rounds of golf. He takes an average of 7 strokes per hole. The par value per hole is 5. How many strokes over par was he?\u003c｜Assistant｜\u003e Okay, so Tom is playing golf, and he’s done 6 rounds. Hmm, that’s a lot, but I guess that’s how it goes. Anyway, he takes an average of 7 strokes per hole. Wait, average strokes per hole? So that means on each hole, on average, he takes 7 strokes. But each hole has a par value, which is the expected number of strokes if he were playing perfectly. In this case, the par value is 5 strokes per hole. So, he’s taking more strokes per hole than the par value, which means he’s over par on each hole. I need to figure out how many strokes over par he was in total over the 6 rounds. So, first, let me break this down. Each hole has a par of 5, so each hole is worth 5 strokes if he plays perfectly. But Tom takes an average of 7 strokes per hole. So, over each hole, he’s taking 7 - 5 = 2 extra strokes. That’s 2 strokes over par on each hole. Now, since he’s playing 6 rounds, and each round has the same number of holes? Wait, actually, does each round have the same number of holes? Hmm, golf rounds can vary in the number of holes, but usually, it’s 18 holes. But the problem doesn’t specify, so maybe I should assume it’s 18 holes each round. Or perhaps, since he’s taking an average of 7 strokes per hole, and each round is 18 holes, so maybe I should calculate the total strokes and then subtract the total par. Wait, the problem says he plays 6 rounds, so if each round is 18 holes, that’s 6 * 18 = 108 holes. But the problem doesn’t specify whether each round has the same number of holes. Hmm, maybe I can assume each round has 18 holes, unless stated otherwise. So, 6 rounds, 18 holes each, so 108 total holes. But another thought: Maybe each round is 18 holes, but par is 5 per hole, so each round’s par is 18 * 5 = 90. So, each round’s par is 90. So, over 6 rounds, total par would be 6 * 90 = 540. Then, Tom’s total strokes are average strokes per hole times number of holes, so 7 strokes per hole * 108 holes = 756 total strokes. So, total strokes over par would be 756 - 540 = 216. Alternatively, another approach: Since he takes 2 strokes over par on each hole, and there are 108 holes, so 2 * 108 = 216 strokes over par. Either way, I get 216. Wait, but hold on, is the number of holes per round specified? The problem says he plays 6 rounds, but doesn’t specify how many holes each round has. Hmm. So, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, if we consider that each round is 18 holes, which is standard, then 6 rounds is 108 holes. So, 108 holes, each hole is par 5. So, total par is 108 * 5 = 540. Tom plays 6 rounds, each round is 18 holes, so 6 * 18 = 108 holes. But wait, Tom is taking an average of 7 strokes per hole. So, his total strokes are 108 * 7 = 756. Therefore, strokes over par is 756 - 540 = 216. Alternatively, since each hole is 5 strokes par, and Tom is taking 7, which is 2 over per hole, so 2 * 108 = 216. Either way, it seems 216 is the answer. Wait, but let me double-check. Let’s say each round is 18 holes. So 6 rounds is 108 holes. Each hole is 5 par. So, total par is 540. Tom’s average is 7 per hole, so total strokes are 756. 756 - 540 is 216. That seems consistent. Alternatively, if each round is a different number of holes, but the problem doesn’t specify, so assuming 18 per round is the standard, so 6 rounds is 108 holes, so 216 strokes over par. Alternatively, maybe the number of rounds is 6, but each round is 18 holes. So, 6 * 18 is 108 holes. So, same as above. Alternatively, if each round has 18 holes, par is 5 per hole, so 5 * 18 = 90 per round. So, 6 rounds, total par is 540. Tom’s total strokes are 7 per hole, so 7 * 108 = 756. So, 756 - 540 = 216. So, yeah, 216 is the number of strokes over par. Alternatively, if each round is a different number of holes, but the problem doesn’t specify, so maybe it’s 18 per round. So, 6 * 18 = 108. So, same as above. Alternatively, if each round is 18 holes, par is 5 per hole, so 90 par per round. 6 rounds, 540 total par. Tom’s total strokes: 7 per hole, 108 holes, 756. So, 756 - 540 is 216. Alternatively, if each round is 18 holes, and Tom’s average is 7 per hole, so he’s 2 over per hole, so 2 * 108 is 216. So, yeah, I think 216 is the answer. Wait, another thought: Is the par value per hole 5? So, on average, each hole is 5 strokes, so Tom is 2 over on each hole, so 2 over times 108 holes is 216 over par. Alternatively, if each round is 18 holes, 6 rounds is 108 holes, 2 over per hole, so 216 over par. So, yeah, 216 is the answer. Final Answer Tom was \\boxed{216} strokes over par. Tom plays 6 rounds of golf and takes an average of 7 strokes per hole. The par value per hole is 5. To determine how many strokes over par he was, we need to calculate the total number of strokes and subtract the total par. 1. Each round has 18 holes, so 6 rounds have (6 \\times 18 = 108) holes. 2. The total par for 108 holes is (108 \\times 5 = 540). 3. Tom’s total strokes are (108 \\times 7 = 756). 4. The number of strokes over par is (756 - 540 = 216). Thus, Tom was (\\boxed{216}) strokes over par.\u003c｜end▁of▁sentence｜\u003e\n",

<p>Tom plays 6 rounds of golf. He takes an average of 7 strokes per hole. The par value per hole is 5. How many strokes over par was he?&lt;｜Assistant｜&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Okay, so Tom is playing golf, and he&rsquo;s done 6 rounds. Hmm, that&rsquo;s a lot, but I guess that&rsquo;s how it goes. Anyway, he takes an average of 7 strokes per hole. Wait, average strokes per hole?

Wait, another thought: Is the par value per hole 5? So, on average, each hole is 5 strokes, so Tom is 2 over on each hole, so 2 over times 108 holes is 216 over par. Alternatively, if each round is 18 holes, 6 rounds is 108 holes, 2 over per hole, so 216 over par. So, yeah, 216 is the answer. <strong>Final Answer</strong> Tom was \boxed{216} strokes over par. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Tom plays 6 rounds of golf and takes an average of 7 strokes per hole. The par value per hole is 5. To determine how many strokes over par he was, we need to calculate the total number of strokes and subtract the total par. 1. Each round has 18 holes, so 6 rounds have (6 \times 18 = 108) holes. 2. The total par for 108 holes is (108 \times 5 = 540). 3. Tom&rsquo;s total strokes are (108 \times 7 = 756). 4. The number of strokes over par is (756 - 540 = 216). Thus, Tom was (\boxed{216}) strokes over par.&lt;｜end▁of▁sentence｜&gt;</p>
