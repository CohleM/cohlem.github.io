    <main><h1>Matrix Visualization</h1>
<p>24 Dec 2024 - cohlem</p>

<p>In deep learning, it’s important to visualize a matrix and how it is represented in a dimension space because the operations that we perform on those matrix becomes very much intuitive afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="visualizing-two-dimensional-matrix">Visualizing two dimensional matrix.</h3>

<p>This has to be the most intuitive visualization.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[ [12, 63, 10, 42, 70, 31, 34, 8, 34, 5],
[10, 97, 100, 39, 64, 25, 86, 22, 31, 25],
[28, 44, 82, 61, 70, 94, 22, 88, 89, 56] ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can simply imagine rows are some examples and columns as those examples’ features.</p>

<h3 id="visualizing-three-dimensional-matrix">Visualizing three dimensional matrix.</h3>

<p>let’s imagine we have a matrix M with the values</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>M =
[
  [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
    [10, 11, 12]
  ],
  [
    [13, 14, 15],
    [16, 17, 18],
    [19, 20, 21],
    [22, 23, 24]
  ]
]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>it is of dimension (2,4,3). How do we visualize it?
The key to visualizing a three dimensional matrix is to image it like a two dimensional matrix but only that it’s first dimension is stacked behind one after another.</p>

<p>for instance, for the same matrix image it like it is (4,3) matrix but two of these are stacked behind one after another.</p>

<p>let’s understand it using an image.</p>

<p><img src="sub-notes/Matrix-Visualization/fig1.png" alt="fig1" />
as you can see from this size of the view we can mostly see its last two dimensions i.e (4,3).</p>

<p>Let’s take another view.
<img src="sub-notes/Matrix-Visualization/fig2.png" alt="fig2" /></p>

<p>as you can see that 2 examples are stacked behind one another.</p>
